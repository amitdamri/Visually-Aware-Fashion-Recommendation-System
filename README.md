# Visually-Aware-Fashion-Recommendation-System
This project is an implementation of the DVBPR part of following paper:
Wang-Cheng Kang, Chen Fang, Zhaowen Wang, Julian McAuley. *[Visually-Aware Fashion Recommendation and Design with Generative Image Models.](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/icdm17.pdf)* In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'17)

We rewrite the code to work with tesorflow 2.5, and suggested an improvement based on ImageNet model and Convolutional AutoEncoder model.
